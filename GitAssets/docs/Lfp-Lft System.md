# üîé LFP / LFT System

The **Looking For Players (LFP) / Looking For Team (LFT)** system is designed to help gamers connect with teammates and groups efficiently. Users can submit structured requests, which are reviewed by staff before being shared in public channels.

Other players can then view **approved requests** and directly contact the original poster.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-game Support**: Valorant, Counter-Strike 2, League of Legends (Easily extensible via JSON)
- **JSON Configuration**: Games and fields defined in config files, no code changes needed
- **Game-Specific Channels**: Separate review and public channels for each game
- **Request Management**: Create, edit, delete, cancel, and resend requests
- **Status Tracking**: Pending, approved, declined, archived, expired, cancelled, deleted
- **Auto-cleanup**: Automatic expiration and archiving of old requests
- **Staff Review**: Moderation system with approval/decline workflow
- **Comprehensive Notifications**: Detailed DM notifications for all actions
- **Action Logging**: Complete audit trail with beautiful formatting
- **Smart Edit Logic**: Editing approved requests resets them for review
- **Permission System**: Role-based access control and ownership validation
- **Dynamic Modals**: Modal fields generated automatically from JSON configuration

## ‚öôÔ∏è JSON Configuration System

The LFP/LFT system uses JSON configuration files to define games and their modal fields. This makes adding new games extremely easy - just edit the JSON files!

### Configuration Files

#### `src/Structure/Configs/LFConfig/lfp.json`
Defines LFP (Looking For Players) games and their fields.

#### `src/Structure/Configs/LFConfig/lft.json`
Defines LFT (Looking For Team) games and their fields.

### JSON Structure

```json
{
  "gameKey": {
    "reviewChannel": "ENV_VAR_NAME",
    "publicChannel": "ENV_VAR_NAME", 
    "displayName": "Game Display Name",
    "fields": [
      {
        "id": "fieldId",
        "label": "Field Label",
        "style": "SHORT|PARAGRAPH",
        "required": true|false,
        "placeholder": "Placeholder text",
        "maxLength": 100
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Field Properties

- **`id`**: Unique identifier for the field (used in database)
- **`label`**: Display name shown to users
- **`style`**: `SHORT` for single line, `PARAGRAPH` for multi-line
- **`required`**: Whether the field is mandatory
- **`placeholder`**: Hint text shown in the input field
- **`maxLength`**: Maximum character limit (optional)

### Adding a New Game

1. **Add to JSON files**: Edit both `lfp.json` and `lft.json`
2. **Define fields**: Specify the fields specific to that game
3. **Set channels**: Reference environment variables for channels
4. **Restart bot**: The changes take effect immediately

### Example: Adding Rocket League

**lfp.json:**
```json
{
  "rocketleague": {
    "reviewChannel": "RL_LF_REVIEW_CHANNEL_ID",
    "publicChannel": "RL_LFP_LFT_CHANNEL_ID",
    "displayName": "Rocket League",
    "fields": [
      {
        "id": "teamName",
        "label": "Team Name",
        "style": "SHORT",
        "required": true,
        "placeholder": "e.g., Apatite",
        "maxLength": 100
      },
      {
        "id": "ranksNeeded",
        "label": "Ranks Needed",
        "style": "SHORT",
        "required": true,

      },
      {
        "id": "playstyle",
        "label": "Playstyle",
        "style": "PARAGRAPH",
        "required": false,
        "placeholder": "Aggressive, defensive, etc...",
        "maxLength": 500
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**lft.json:**
```json
{
  "rocketleague": {
    "reviewChannel": "RL_LF_REVIEW_CHANNEL_ID",
    "publicChannel": "RL_LFP_LFT_CHANNEL_ID",
    "displayName": "Rocket League",
    "fields": [
      {
        "id": "epicID",
        "label": "Epic ID",
        "style": "SHORT",
        "required": true,
        "placeholder": "e.g., Apatite",
        "maxLength": 100
      },
      {
        "id": "currentRank",
        "label": "Current Rank",
        "style": "SHORT",
        "required": true,
        "placeholder": "e.g., Diamond 2",
        "maxLength": 100
      },
      {
        "id": "preferredRole",
        "label": "Preferred Role",
        "style": "SHORT",
        "required": true,
        "placeholder": "Striker, Midfielder, Defender",
        "maxLength": 100
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
