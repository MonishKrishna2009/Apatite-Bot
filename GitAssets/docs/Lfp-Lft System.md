# üîé LFP / LFT System

The **Looking For Players (LFP) / Looking For Team (LFT)** system is designed to help gamers connect with teammates and groups efficiently. Users can submit structured requests, which are reviewed by staff before being shared in public channels.

Other players can then view **approved requests** and directly contact the original poster.

## ‚ú® Features

## ‚öôÔ∏è JSON Configuration System

The LFP/LFT system uses JSON configuration files to define games and their modal fields. This makes adding new games extremely easy - just edit the JSON files!

### Configuration Files

#### `src/Structure/Configs/LFConfig/lfp.json`
Defines LFP (Looking For Players) games and their fields.

#### `src/Structure/Configs/LFConfig/lft.json`
Defines LFT (Looking For Team) games and their fields.

### JSON Structure

```json
{
  "gameKey": {
    "reviewChannel": "ENV_VAR_NAME",
    "publicChannel": "ENV_VAR_NAME", 
    "displayName": "Game Display Name",
    "fields": [
      {
        "id": "fieldId",
        "label": "Field Label",
        "style": "SHORT|PARAGRAPH",
        "required": true|false,
        "placeholder": "Placeholder text",
        "maxLength": 100
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Field Properties

- **`id`**: Unique identifier for the field (used in database)
- **`label`**: Display name shown to users
- **`style`**: `SHORT` for single line, `PARAGRAPH` for multi-line
- **`required`**: Whether the field is mandatory
- **`placeholder`**: Hint text shown in the input field
- **`maxLength`**: Maximum character limit (optional)

### Adding a New Game

1. **Add to JSON files**: Edit both `lfp.json` and `lft.json`
2. **Define fields**: Specify the fields specific to that game
3. **Set channels**: Reference environment variables for channels
4. **Restart bot**: The changes take effect immediately

### Example: Adding Rocket League

**lfp.json:**
```json

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# Action Logging
LF_ACTION_LOG_CHANNEL_ID=your_action_log_channel_id

# LF System Settings
LF_MOD_ROLE_ID=your_lf_mod_role_id

# LF System Configuration (config.js)
MaxActiveRequest=5                    # Maximum active requests per user
RequestExpiryDays=7                   # Days before pending requests expire
RequestArchiveDays=30                 # Days before approved requests are archived
RequestDeleteDays=60                  # Days before soft-deleted requests are permanently deleted
```

### Channel Setup
1. **Review Channels**: Create separate channels for each game's review process
2. **Public Channels**: Create channels where approved requests are posted
3. **Log Channel**: Create a channel for action logging and accountability
4. **Permissions**: Ensure LF mod role has access to review channels

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure to configure the necessary environment variables and database connections as per the main documentation to enable this system.

## üîÑ Message Recovery System

### Automatic Recovery Features
The LF system includes an intelligent message recovery system that automatically recovers accidentally deleted LF request messages:

#### Recovery Scenarios
- **Pending Requests**: If a review message is accidentally deleted, the system automatically reposts it
- **Approved Requests**: If a public message is accidentally deleted, the system automatically reposts it
- **User Notifications**: Users receive DM notifications when their messages are recovered

#### Protection Against Intentional Deletions
- **Intentional Delete Detection**: The system distinguishes between accidental and intentional deletions
- **Database Consistency**: Message IDs are cleared before deletion to prevent false recovery
- **Race Condition Prevention**: 2-second delay prevents recovery of intentionally deleted messages

#### Recovery Process
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Message Deleted] --> B{Is LF Message?}
    B -- No --> C[Ignore]
    B -- Yes --> D[Wait 2 seconds]
    D --> E{Message ID in DB?}
    E -- No --> F[Intentional Delete - Ignore]
    E -- Yes --> G[Recover Message]
