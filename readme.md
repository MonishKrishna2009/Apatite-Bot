Apatite Bot is a powerful and modular Discord bot built with Node.js and Discord.js v14. It provides advanced logging, ticketing, and utility features to help manage your Discord server efficiently.  

## üöÄ Project Overview

## ‚ú® Features  

### Logging System

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
     ```bash  
     git clone https://github.com/MonishKrishna2009/Apatite-Bot.git
     cd apatite-bot  
     ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
     ```bash  
     bun install
     ```  

3. Set up the configuration file:  
     - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.  
     - Fill in the required fields (see [Configuration](#gear-configuration)).  

4. Start the bot:  
     ```bash  
     bun .  
     ```  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration  

The `.env` file contains all the necessary settings for the bot. Here's an example:  

```bash
# Discord Stuff
TOKEN = ""
CLIENT_ID = ""
CLIENT_SECRET = ""

GUILD_ID = ""

# Database Stuff
MONGO_URI = ""

#Ticket Stuff
TICKET_LOG_CHANNEL_ID = ""
TICKET_DASH_CHANNEL_ID = ""
TICKET_SUPPORT_ROLE_ID = ""

You also need to fill your necessary details in the config.js file inside Structure/Configs folder (I have included the space you probably need to fill)

          id: "1040507183080685658",
        },
      ],
```
